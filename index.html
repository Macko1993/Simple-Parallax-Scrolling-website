  <h2 class="h2">Power Of Desire</h2>
  <p class="p"> Your desire is what fuels your success - if you don't have the desire to achieve your goals - you're not going to achieve it. A goal without a desire is like driving a car without gas. You're simply not going to get anywhere.If you want to achieve your goals you need to have the desire to achieve your goal or you have to have the right desire associated with that goal.What's Your Desire?

Let's face it - we all want a lot of things and we all would like to have a lot of different things in our lives - but wanting and desiring something are very different. For example: you may want to make more money - but what do you really desire? If you think that money will give you more time, more security, more freedom - then what you really desire is freedom, security, more time and perhaps a comfortable lifestyle. You want more money - but you really desire something completely different - something that you think having more money will allow you to achieve.After he lost his most recent fight Mike Tyson said: "I lost my desire, I'm not hungry anymore. I'm wealthy, my kids have money, I have nothing to fight for." Tyson's desire to fight was to be wealthy and make sure that his family was financially secure. Filling his ego with the notion that he was heavyweight champ didn't matter anymore. Since he had the money – fighting wasn't necessary to him and there was no desire to fight. He wanted to make some more money, he wanted to come back and be champ again - but he had no real desire.

Muhammad Ali, on the other hand, had a burning desire to be heavyweight champion of the world. His desire wasn't money - it was fame. That's why he always came back - until his body could no longer fulfill his desire.

Nelson Mandela had a burning desire not just for personal freedom - but for the freedom of all blacks in South Africa.

Bill Gates has a desire to see a computer in every home in the world – and we're almost at that point.You too can begin improving your life.
Yes you can create the coincidences to achieve success, happiness and much more.
Take control of your thoughts and you change your life. Start today - don't waste another moment creating the life you don't want. Remember - this is it. This is the only life you have. Use your incredible powers to make the most of it.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">Dream Big Set Goals Get Better</h2>
  <p class="p">How often can you say this year you’ve set yourself a goal and as life takes over those goals come and go unmet?That’s because “a dream without action is merely a wish” and unless here is a set deadline, it’s just another thing we said that we would do that we didn’t.But why would we even set a goal? Is it because we like feeing perpetually like a loser or underachiever of do we set the goals because we know that if we hit enough of them we might just get our big dream?
Thing is, when our needs continually go unmet we grow resentful, angry, lethargic or all three!Our needs and our dreams are important – and when we take a little time out to put them at the top of our priorities, the resentment is minimised and the happiness maximised.Just take one hour a day to focus on your dream and the current goal you’re trying to achieve.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.</h2>
  <p class="p"> Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.’ Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along. </p>
